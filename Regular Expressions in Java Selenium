=>Use of Regular Expressions in Selenium Test Automation:
"element_\\d+"; // Matches "element_" followed by one or more digits

In terms of Automation regular expressions can be particularly useful when dealing with dynamic web elements, verifying text patterns, or extracting data from web pages. 
Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. Few most commonly used regular expressions in Java Selenium Test Automation are like.

ðŸ‘‰ Matching Text Patterns :-
Regular expressions can be used to match specific patterns within strings, allowing you to verify expected text in web elements. E.g. to validate an email address
entered in a form, you can use the regular expression like..

âž¡ String emailPattern = "^\w+@[a-zA-Z_]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$";

In this corrected pattern: {^\\w+@[a-zA-Z_]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$} - Boz Java considers / as escape character. so we have used two //

1. ^ asserts the start of the string.
2. \\w+ matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores), representing the username part of the email.
3. @ matches the "@" character.
4. [a-zA-Z_]+ matches one or more letters or underscores, representing the domain name.
5. \\. matches the dot "." character (Note the double backslash to escape the dot).
6. [a-zA-Z]{2,} matches at least two or more letters for the top-level domain (TLD) part of the email.
7. $ asserts the end of the string.

ðŸ‘‰ Handling Dynamic Elements :-
We pages often contain dynamic elements with changing IDs, classes, or other attributes. Regular expressions can help identify and interact with such elements. 
E.g. if the ID of a button changes dynamically but always starts with "btn_submit_", you can locate it using a regular expression like..

âž¡ String buttonIdPattern = "btn_submit_\\d+";
The String variable buttonIdPattern appears to contain a regular expression for matching button IDs that follow a specific pattern. The pattern you've provided, 
"btn_submit_\\d+", should work to match button IDs that start with "btn_submit_" followed by one or more digits. Here's what this regular expression does:

1. "btn_submit_": This part of the pattern matches the literal text "btn_submit_" exactly.
2. \\d+: This part of the pattern matches one or more digits (0-9).

So, when you use this pattern, it will successfully match button IDs like "btn_submit_1", "btn_submit_42", and so on.

ðŸ‘‰ Extracting Data :-
Regular expression also enables you to extract data from web pages, such as retrieving a specific portion of a URL or extraction numbers from a string. E.g. 
if you want to extract the numeric portion from a product price displayed as "$99.99", you can use regular expression like..

âž¡ String pricePattern = "\\d+\\.\\d{2}";
The String variable pricePattern appears to contain a regular expression for matching prices in the format of whole numbers followed by a decimal point and two decimal places (e.g., "123.45"). The pattern you've provided, "\\d+\\.\\d{2}", should work for this purpose. Here's what this regular expression does:

1. \\d+: This part of the pattern matches one or more digits (0-9). This represents the whole number part of the price.
2. \\.: This part of the pattern matches a literal dot (".") character. The backslash (\\) is used to escape the dot because it has a special meaning in regular expressions.
3. \\d{2}: This part of the pattern matches exactly two digits (0-9) after the dot. This represents the decimal part of the price, which should have two decimal places.

So, when you use this pattern, it will successfully match strings that represent prices in the format you've described, such as "123.45" or "9.99"

ðŸ‘‰ Replacing Text :-
Regular expression allow you to replace or modify specific portions of text. This can be useful when updating dynamic content or removing unwanted characters. 
E.g you want remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string so for that you can use regular expression like..

âž¡ String cleanText = originalText.replaceAll ("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "");
The String operation replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "") is used to remove all characters from the originalText string that are not alphanumeric (letters or digits). 
Here's how it works:

1. [^a-zA-Z0-9] is a regular expression pattern that matches any character that is not in the range of lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, or digits 0 to 9.
2. "" (an empty string) is the replacement, which effectively removes all characters matched by the regular expression.

So, when you use replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", ""), it will replace all non-alphanumeric characters in originalText with an empty string, effectively cleaning the text 
and leaving only letters and digits.
E.g: String cleanText = originalText.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z]", "") => o/p = HelloworldThisisatest
     String cleanText = originalText.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", ""); => o/p = HelloworldThisisa123test
     String cleanText = originalText.replaceAll("[^ A-Z0-9]", ""); => o/p = H  T   123 
     String cleanText = originalText.replaceAll("[^A-Z0-9]", ""); => o/p = HT123
